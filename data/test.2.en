black would have been much better off doing rxh4 , because eventually , that pawn does become a queen .
... but qa5+ is much better
in that case the rook sits better on the f-file .
perhaps black might have been better with the pawn exchange at this point , but the knight would have had to move anyway .
i believe that this position is a theoretical draw , but i think i have slightly better winning chances because of my control of the e-file , stopping black 's king from coming into play .
i thought moving the rook along the d-file was better because it keeps my king from advancing to the centre .
i think bg5 would have been better here .
o-o would have been better here .
black is better prepared than white right now to face this plan .
there was for sure a lot of other better moves but when i have seen that i have an oportunity to sac a rook and do that kind of combination , i just could n't stop it !
finally found a much better solution , with the move of the rook everything had changed .
unfortunately this move was a waste of tempo and glenda would have been better served on h1 to enable henry to get sanctuary on the queenside and to stop the wicked witch and her henchmen pouring in via the kingside .
on balance , despite my previous note i think g7 is the better choice .
the writing was n't the best , but i promise it will get better !
taking with the rook would have been better ; white would be left with slight material disadvantage but in a safe position and a spot for the second rook on f1 , now the king is out open
i took with the queen , was nxd2 better ?
computer says b6 was better , preparing for the bishop on b7 and recommends i move to kf2 rather than castling ... interesting .
and if he wants to open my h file all the better .
so it 's better if black exchanges here .
pawn move is unnecessary ( 5.bg5 loses tempo for white although it does create a weakness in black 's structure , but 4 ... be7 is much better for black
better were ... bg7 and ... ne7
this is dubious , black wants to postpone his knights departure from h5 for as long as possible , which is perfectly reasonable , but ... f5 is better here .
and that is not how to do so , ... nf6 was better , exchanging the defender of d6 which can then be captured with development .
black is probably better after 17 ... qa5 18.qxa5 rxa5 19.nf6 kd8 , the text move smacks of materialism and allows white to continue with a strong attack on black 's centralised king
perhaps better was nc3 .
better would have ben re7 .
furthermore it would have been better to castle than just play 14 .
qe2 might have been a better choice .
maybe , or probably 10 ... dxc6 is better to have a queenside castle more sure
nxf6 definately looks the better of the two .
not a bad play , but i think that bxc4 or kxc4 would be better .
it 's suggested that ktxe4 is a better move because it leads to : ktxkt .. pd5 .
however , considering that the standard series of moves leads to equality the following series of moves could work out to be even better .
i think a better move is available instead of knight to e7 .
i had thought about using the h pawn instead of the f pawn but i felt better opening up my rook on f1 .
i move my knight to the rear which is better than either h4 or d2 .
i advance a pawn to my opponent 's knight and unless he wants to retreat he will check my king into a better position ... .
my king is checked into a better position .
black is maneuvering his e4 rook to a better position to operate with his other rook .
black is trying to figure out a better position for his own fa and so far it seems to me he is doing the best with what he has .
black loses the knight if that pawn is advanced on the h side and there is nothing threatening me to make a better move .
i have to retreat fa to a better position ... .
how can i keep better track of the queen .
much better was re8 , getting the rook off of the dark square .
the knight probably had a better spot on d5 .
c4 is probably better as it locks up the position more and the goal of white is to keep the game closed up and prevent black 's bishop pair from really controlling the game .
giving the king somewhere to run to , moving the h pawn up is probably better here though .
accepting the sacrifice is probably better , but my coach decided to be cautious .
bf6+ is still better for white , but black can still hope to hang on .
12 ... .. 0-0 was probably better 13 bf7 may be worth a look 14 nec6 is probably better and bxb2 on move 15 gave you better chances .
qe2 is probably better , as it still allows rd1 , protecting the d pawn , and protects ng3
ne4 may have been better as this regulates the knight to the edge of the board for most of the rest of the game .
better is nf4 , centralizing the knight .
rc1 , 40 kh2 bxb ! , but this , i believe can be avoided better by 39 .
castling was perhaps premature : 8. a3 might have suited better .
-1.02 ) qxg4 is better
some shelter is better than none !
f4 is n't better due to nxf4 and a threat to a discovered check with an attack on the e1 knight , as an example of a possible sequence : bh6 nd3+ g3 nxe1
a better response to the fork would have been the more aggressive 17.bxb5+ , which would have forced black to defer the execution of his fork while he responded to the attack on his king .
a much better move would have been .
i took with the pawn to have better pawn structure
however , nf6 would have been better .
better was 5 ... bd6 where his bishop is n't crammed .
better was 8 ... g7 so then he 's be able to get his dsb out immediately .
but , what he will play next answers my question , as he 'll find a good place to put his n. however , i view this as a waste of time since he could have found a better place in one , as opposed to , three moves .
however , i think that better was 29.bd2 .
another option which was slightly better would have been 36 ... kh8 , as it avoids , but then comes the immediate family fork , 37.ng6+ winning white 's q .
maybe a wasted move by bl , perhaps moving bishop to g3 would have been better , allowing the knight on h3 to move to a more productive position instead of stuck protecting the bishop .
fritz turned out to be better than chess titans on his highest level , quod erat demonstrandum .
kxb is better , because white preserves the f pawn .
i thought about bd3 or e2 , but figured this would be better .
it keeps me equal and # 2 , even better , the king has to take it .
the simple 8.nb3 was better .
materially , it 's an even trade , but since black is trading away his developed pieces , i feel the trade is better for white .
i guess 6 ... nc6 followed by 7 ... rc8 would have been better .
according to maroczy , `` white 's position is slightly better , '' , but in kasparov 's opinion after 28.b3 black can not hold out .
and white wants to control the center so moves c4 ; but e4 is probably better .
e6 or d5 would have been much better .
better was the bishop , so the knight would have the f3 space available .
better was be6 or bd7 .
this is not the best choice by white either ; better was trading bishops for white .
better is 1
but i 'm better developed and more maneuverable , and it 's better to have a speculative plan than no plan at all !
rxd3 , but i thought i could get a better position by reducing the effectiveness of a possible nf4 .
and in hindsight , maybe bxd8 was indeed better .
a tough move to find , but much better than rxe3 , which disrupts the gun and does n't prevent nf4 like the text does .
i could n't see anything better that to wait for the ox to fall on my face ...
just fine , but much wiser would have be to play kd7 , preventing my bishop 's next move .
would qf4 have been better ?
still , maybe kc2 would be better ?
i think better move would be bc4 .
it 's difficult to suggest a w 's better .
better would have been ...
i think moving up pawn to f3 would have been a better move
qe4 would have been better .
i think i will try d4 and c4 , which i 've heard are better moves than e4 and f4 .
nc3 was better .
is far better , as the knight on a5 is still threatened , and be4 fork is still on the cards , and rd1 generates a new threat of bd7+ winning the black queen .
if black can develop quickly , he will have the better game .
not only was bxe4 probably better , but maybe i could have just played nxd3 here .
i suppose i got so focused on my plan that i forgot to search for alternatives which are clearly better .
light squares might give white some counter play against them , but still i 'm better placed to attack white 's pawns , just have to find a hole to pass my rook on to the other wing
i would 've promoted , at once but like this move better though since his monarch will have less options .
but perhaps qc7 for control of the e5 square was better .
black does not want a potential second break , and he wants to maneuver his knight into a better position while opening up the diagonal for his bishop .
**** making such a move is usually a sign that you can not think of anything better to do .
a better move would 've been 10 ... .qe7 , forcing the queens off the board with : 11.ne4+ kd7 12.kd1 qxf7 13.bxf7 kd8 .
a better move here is to take a rook to an open file .
a better approach here is to target my king with something like ng5 .
rc1 was better perhaps .
a6 is played by black , i thought developing another minor piece would have been better , but he had a reason for this move i am sure .
if black 's idea is to attack white 's centre , then c5 was a better try .
or is it that white does n't have better ideas like maybe just playing knight to e2 or rook to g1 and i ca n't see much wrong in those options .
qxe1 would have been better by simply offering trade of queens to draw the game .
white over reacts to the bishop , better is to develop in preparation for castling .
better was 4.ne2 .
better , however , was simply to castle .
much better would have been first to take on b6 : 11.nxb6 !
... but i think that capablanca is in little better position
perhaps qg3 would be a better move .
but the bishop would be better placed elsewhere .
and white is better the threat now is rd1 to win the queen and e5 with a pawn fork on knight and queen
i had so many options here but i chose to keep the pawn advance going simply to keep pressure on his king ... .on reflection this was the wrong move maybe qa4 would have been better ...
this seems a much better place for my knight , it 's almost impossible to budge at the moment and causes maximum inconvenience for black , his queen now ca n't move on the d8-h4 diagonal
this seems a better location for the queen .
perhaps fxg4 would have been better , but i did n't want to block my queen .
i saw little better ...
i thought f5 would have been better , since there 's a neat little trick in the following line : 31 ... f5 32. exf5 bxf5 33 .
nf6 , be7 or bg4 would have been better .
i like the idea of moving the king better - all this seems to do is restrict black 's rook
better would be nf3 i guess ...
better is getting the knight into the game with nf5-nd3
d3 is usally a better move
better was ka2 .
if i 'm going to beat a player of better caliber than myself , i 've learned that i need the game to be more of an open than a closed position .
dieselengine9 ) nc3 : i couldnt really think of anything better to do that i could n't still do with this knight developed
i think it would have been better to take the exchange on c5 rather than this .
dieselengine9 ) bg4 : nothin better to do
better than the rest , watson ?
although not cramped , i remember susan polgar mentioning about the importance of getting the knight to a better outpost .
much better would 've been 8.dxc5 .
better than dxc5 7 .
obviously taking with the bishop is better than the rook !
i was not satisfied with bd5 , or nd5 , so i thought that it was better to let c3 free for my queen .
if rxg3 , b4 , ne2 is slightly better , since i have room for my king to go to b1-a1 to stop the a pawn .
hmm ... would kh1 have been better ?
my bishop was awful and useless on h2 , so i plan to move onto a better square via h2-d6-b4-c3 .
b7 might have been a better move .
a better move would be to check my again with his queen by going black queen to e8 .
better was be6 and later develop the knight to c6
... exd5 is more common and probably better
yet , as my opponent pointed out to me after the game , g6 was probably objectively better as this weakens the a2-g8 diagonal which becomes a thorn in my side .
but a better defence would have been 20 .
this would be better for 4 reasons : 1 .
wh ) it must be better to play 18 p-b3 b-q2 199 n-n6 followed by nxb , though black is still a little better
some people have made a life purpose to prove that this is better than 1. e4 or vice-versa .
white 's idea is more than to win a pawn , which does n't even count as a full pawn , what he 's really after is a better endgame .
again , 19. d5 would have been better .
taking with the knight might have been slightly better but in both cases , i can claim at least equality .
taking with the knight is objectively better , since white gets some activity but black wo n't have much trouble in repulsing the early initiative .
slightly better than 13 ... bf5 , because i have no desire to push the e-pawn right now and from here the bishop controls the very important square d5 .
qd2 would have been better .
qxe3 was better since it would have posed black the question if he can really capture on a2 .
21 ... b5 might be objectively better , but i was looking for opportunities to exchange pieces .
perhaps 18 ... bxe3+ was better .
i knew he would move his knight , but ne2 may have been better .
does it seem better only to me ?
i saw that i could find a better place for my rook : d i wrote him again on msn : i retreat my rook here , and i 'm also protecting my g7 pawn : d rf7 he replied : -but you are n't protect your e5 pawn ... qxe5
i also had no better idea , but to start bringing my king in the battle .
a better place for the bishop is on g5 where it pins the black knight .
qa5 is slightly better .
5. d3 might have been better .
this is not the best move i could of played something better , developing a minor piece would have been better .
i was about to f4 to protect the pawn , could that of been a better move ?
i think castling here would have been a better move .
a better move was to exchange knight 's .
the pawn was a better choice .
probably 21.ne2 was better , to begin a queenside mobilization .
i made this move with the intent to move rh3 and bear down on the h-file , but it had been much better to simply proceed with the original plan and break open the g-file with 26.gxf5 , where 26 ... nxf5 can be met with 27.qf6+ rg7 28.rxg6 qxg6 29.qxd8+ .
but i still think qe2 would have been better .
a better move here would have been to retreat the knight to d1 .
a better move would be nb1 to protect the rook at a3 and the c3 square .
black would probably be better off taking the pawn , cxpb4 .
nc4+ was immensely better .
better for me to trade off his strong bishop
the knight is a more useful piece in the attack , so it occupies a better square .
qf4 might have been better
therefore , 6.bd2 was better .
better than i saw .
i am not sure why he did this ... perhapses for lack of anything better to do personally i would be attacking my queen , even if it cost me some king safety .
this is why after 3 ... e6 , i think it would 've been better to defend with the move played here .
though , now i regret it and think that better was to exchange since i 'm ahead .
still aiming at d7 , too sure of my position , i did n't try to protect my bishops , be3 would have been better
d5 would have been a better move , in my opinion
would knight to g3 have been better ?
better alternatives would have been 7.0-0 or maybe even 7.f3 -
i think this is a little early and white would have been better placed by developing a piece
better would be g4 , trapping the bishop .
a better move would have lost the pawn , however , and lead to a drawn endgame .
i think that better was to develop something .
therefore , i use that opportunity to get the n better placed , as it appears .
but , better might have been 16 ... b5 as that chain is there .
i think that the best move , however , would 've been 6 ... nb6 as my n is better placed , at once .
better is 6 .
i tend to do better with less pieces on the field .
nf1 is better , to `` rebounce '' on e3 , then d5 or f5 .
better than q and n exchanged that would lead to a draw
i move my knight here in a better position .
i could n't really think of a better move to do .
white moves his bishop to a more agressive square , but i think it 's better if white trades bishops and starts an attack f4-f5
i dont think bd3 would be better , if e5 , and nd7 moving , b can threaten my n moving on g4 .
a better plan may have been to leave the pawn where it was and played something like bb8
a reasonable move , though would have worked better had white kept his bishop on g5 .
defending the b2 pawn , however much better would have been e3
this move was unnecessary , far better would have been 14 ... f6 .
white correctly does n't take the rook , but better would be c3 to block my next move
i think better here would have been 16 ... d5 , which would open up the d-file , which has my queen and rook .
defending the pawn , as well as switching the queen-rook action to the e-file , but maybe g4 would have been a better idea
i wonder if re1 might have been better .
6 ... qn-q2 , continuing to develop , is better .
nd7 or h5 might be better
keeping the h1/a8 diagonal open and better than 8 ... .exd
better move that rook .
this is where i was hoping to be in the end , i thought that c8 is a better move then e8 for the blacks king
better would have been g3 .
with his passive bishop gone , the king-side advance would have significantly better prospects . }
i can not say the black bishop is better than the white one .
i believe here ra4 is better with capturing the c4 pawn or d4 one , because it prevent a good queen 's pawn structure in the future
i feel this weakens the castle unnecessarily , particularly when cxd5 is just as good if not better .
it seems g4 was better , as white has problems with protecting his d4 pawn .
slightly better was 23.rf2 .
... d5 seems to give black better results
bxp gives white a much better version of a danish set-up ; the queen and knight are both out as well .
was probably better , threatening bg2 ( by black
probably nc6 was much better .
not entirely sure why i choose this over bxc6 , but i may of felt c6 was a dead cause and re positioning the knight would be a better option .
this was another case of holding my horses : - ) and not immediately taking the rook but looking around for a better move
kc6 here is better as it gets the king a little more room to manuever
and perhaps it would have been wiser ...
i think it might have been better to capture with the b2 pawn instead , since white 's centre may later be weakened by the absence of centrl pawns ?
rd3 or might have been better - preparing to double rooks on the d file .
but perhaps moving a rook to d8 straight away is better ?
would rook f1 have been better ?
g3 may have been better here - since that does not lead to a further reduction in material on the board .
bd4 would have been better , followed by bf2 , defending e1 from the pawn promotion threat .
the outcome would not have been any better for him had he played on though : 36 .
white correctly starts queen-side operations - although maybe ne4 was better .
white 's center is still better , but i have a slight material edge and better pawn structure .
again , better for black is removing the queen from the d column , and try to attack as quicly as possible .
better was nf8 .
better than say retreating d7 or c8 the move played allows for the bishop to give a sermon to white when it later lands on c4 with a devastating blow .
the rook is better on a6 than c8 , but allowing check in the back rank forces ... bf8 which , of course , restricts the bishop .
i must say that i 'm not too happy with myself landing in this position , where white has the better bishop and some activity for the modest price of a pawn .
nc6 would have been better .
better is kf1 , leading to 32 ... qxh2 33.a6 f6 34.qa2 qd6 35.a7 kf7 36.qb2 h6 37.ra1 kg7 , which loses a pawn . ''
better than the entombing option , bh8 .
i did n't know what was going to come on the queenside , but this move seemed like it was better protection for the king , plus it stops black from knight-checking the king on e2 or d3 .
the knight would do better on e3 than c3 , though , so i prepare to get it there .
fxe3 was better .
11 ... qc7 is better and safer
be2 would been better , would released knight from pin .
slighty better is ng3
computer analysis calls bxf4 a serious miscue by black and better is nxd4 whichs leads to qe1 and nxf3 which forks king and queen and easily resolved by rxf3 .
slighty better is qxd4 .
allows black a forcd mate oportunity and better is rxf4
exd5 might have been better because it does n't drop a central pawn .
maybe better was to take with the queen , allowing the knight to arrive on more natural c6 after .
nc3 was better .
if someone had the tactical skill of a world champion , but the positional knowledge of a weak club player , they could make it to top 1000 in the nation , probably much better .
i will move my queen to a better place ;
much better then 9.bxf6 because after 9 ... qxf6 , i can play 10 ... nd4 , and after 11.nxd4 , bxd4 , f2 becomes a target with my q+dsb '' like before , i agreed by nodding my head especially because i recently learned from tactical-abyss that f2 for white and f7 for black are the weakest squares .
rd1 was a better solution to keep the momentum .
o-o-o [ is a little better . ]
qc1 [ is a little better . ]
better was 19 .
qe5 is better .
in hindsight , maybe the bishop would have been better on e2 .
now i can see why the white queen is better on the 3rd line .
i decide to trade because my endgame looks better than his .
... probably better than 6 ... ke7 which would result in the king going for a walk .
this move seems better than f5 , leading to something like 8 .
seems better than gxf6 .
better was bc4 , pinning the f pawn so the knight can escape .
better was f4 , avoiding my 19th move .
loses the bishop , better was kd2 or kd1 as mentioned in the previous note .
... b5 also works , and is probably better .
definitely better than 3 .
the 15th and 16th moves have achieved nothing , except the white 's position is better .
even the chess engine suggests 18.0-0 but i was felt that the rook had better chances of getting action via the h-file .
# 1 it temporarily lessens the pressure on f2 long enough for me to better position my dsb .
bb4 would have been a better bishop move , or h3 would have removed the threat of the pin .
rxa2 would have been better ?
ra7 may have been better ?
i knew that later i would better attack h5 with g4 .
better would 've been d6 .
i 'm not sure g5 would have been any better , and given the following exchange , i 'd say it was the right move .
better was probably nf6 .
better might have been kh7 .
better than nc6 , it opens the way for the queen .
it seemed an ok attacking move for black , but he should have better played dxe3 , since i had to recapture with fxe3 , creating a weakness on e3 ( bxn , bxb , qxe3 , qe2 , and i am in big trouble .
black 's lb moves again to g6 and i think i am probably looking better in terms of development as black has had to make 3 moves with his lb and i have gained development whilst defending .
perhaps better would have been to make that move at the start and then he could have been moving his g8 knight out with that last move .
the f1 square is protected by the lb so believe this move to be better .
better for black could have been rfb8 , i think , as it forces me to reconsider the place of the far more important b1 bishop .
probably the better idea , but qd5 would have been stronger .
10. c4 would have been a much better move .
who 's king is better placed ?
better is g6 , it blocks the queen .
bringing his n to a better out post .
although i went overboard with the rook , by taking and constantly showing the chess bits and wisdoms i wound up playing better then expected .
a better move , in my analysis , would 've been ke2 just to keep the king active .
moving back to either c1 or d1 would 've been better .
i will then be able to use this information to better place my pieces rather then trying to place it in a good spot now
decided that this square is better than g3 as the knight attacks the bishop on g4 which will have to move otherwise i get the bishop pair
bc3 , does turn out to be no good and only wastes important time that could have been put to better use .
saw no better move here and reasoned that this rook could be happy practically anywhere on e , ... with the 4th and 5th rank having `` some '' `` potential '' for lateral travel .
better to leave black 's pawns alone here , ... to inhibit his heavy pieces ?
... ... .better for white is r-e1 ... ! ! ! ... ... ... .if..
better might have been r-f1 ... ... ( ( not ...
a clear white plus ) this has to be regarded as dubious , although white was slightly better in any case .
rc7 and white is better , but winning it will be hard .
withdrawing that bishop to d3 might have been better but here i was to get rid of the only valuable black bishop .
black king is in safe , but after exchanges i want to bring in a pawn , that is why the king better stands in the middle .
it 's hard to know if i should do it normal , or if it 's better to transition into something else .
the question is if it will work here or if i have a better move .
... ... . f6 - qxf7 # had to be defended against but was qe7 better ?
... .. qe7 - would ne7 been better here ?
white will have to snatch that pawn to sooner or later , but the later , the better .
the idea is finding a better square for his n. that is , on b6 , which he will do , on his next move .
as noted , black finds a better outpost for his n .
its better to have there a b than a q ...
better for white is to take , and try be2 , etc , begging black does n't find something along the way ...
... bxf3 30. gxf3 qd6 is better , but white can play rhg1 or rag1 to try to generate g-file counterplay .
kd2 forced and black has nothing better than bxr - and i doubt i would have played it , since bd4 by white would have sealed the draw ) and ... b4 !
as will be clear later , f3 or h3 would have been better .
in the meantime , i deploy my nc3 to a better outpost , as per susan polgar 's advise , in terms of , strategy .
so , i said that better was to exchange .
my oponent rejected the offer and proceeded as planned - but i was worried what i had missed ... ... ke3 kd6 d4 might have been better for white ?
i considered a move like 13 ) ng3 ( which probably would have been better ) , but i decided that i would have enough pressure to form an attack even without the queens on the board .
considering that black is down a pawn , it would probably be better to have avoided the trade .
as i said , i think castle king side was a better move .
i think better was 24 .
and for white , i also think deep blue was also choosing better moves .
i do n't think d3 would be any better- it was time to move this pawn .
black could maybe entertain bb7 , to pressure e4 , or perhaps rb8 , planning b4 , but i think this is better .
black wants the knight in a better home , having a certain idea in mind if white pushes again ...
moreover , would it have worked better before the knight trade ?
after all , i ca n't say it 's not doing much better on e3 , and black would be forced to move the queen again .
at the very least- would n't reb1 have been better , to help in some way in case axb5 ?
would n't f6 be better ?
i think white 's is clearly better , thanks to the guard on e4 , and e5 is left miserably lonely ...
but i wonder if black has any better moves .
but could white do any better by acting on any of his threats right here instead of nf5 ?
is qc7 , planning bxc7 after qxc7 , any better for black ?
white 's queen needs to get off the b-file , and i 'm not sure if qc6 right now is any better .
rxc3 a5 is better .
i thought the queen capture was better than the king , but if someone else does n't think so , please drop a comment .
although time-consuming , in retrospect it might have been better for black to engineer queenside castling .
i dont get the q over to the h row yet , better to advance the 2 rooks right down the h file and the q will come in later
i think rf2 was better
better is 6 ... .kh8 .
could n't think of anything better ...
bh5 is better since it retains the pin and the chasing move g4 weakens white 's position .
i decide to fork her queen and b4 pawn to win a pawn , but it gets better .
a better post might have been c2 .
however , a preemptive 20.g3 would be better , as this move gives black enough time to really load on the pressure .
nf3 would have been better , but i 'm not sure .
i thought on c5 my queen could protect my weaknesses better .
ours is better ! !
i felt that g4 followed by f4 was too drawish and i had better chances with my queenside pawns ( a thought that i needed to pay better attention to , later ) .
perhaps better is ... rd6 .
if white is allowed to solidify his centre then he is guaranteed better endgame chances .
better would be 3 ... cxd4 , exchanging a wing pawn for a central one and opening the c-file to attack .
given white 's response , perhaps it would have been better to take on a3 .
and white is simply better , probably winning .
i wondered if taking with the other pawn was better , as it opens a second line of attack onto d4 and keeps the g4 bishop defended , but i do n't see that black can derive much advantage from this .
surely 19 ... qe8 , supporting c6 and defending h5 , was the better queen move here ?
... but this could be better ?
usually , when the q retreats , the opponent can continue developing , get better control of the center , and castle sooner .
a better move might have been qe7 .
again , better than nc6 , since it allows the c pawn to move .
better was kg8 , so to leave this square for the ne8 .
better here than on b5 or c4 , which would threaten nothing .
generally thought of as better than the alternative kg8 .
bxd3 would of been better actually , but then again , black is attacking king-side .
i knew it was better to keep a good pawn structure for my king , thus , i took with the queen instead of the g2 pawn .
i think possibly d2 or c2 might have been better .
i think that 0-0-0 would have been better and have yielded the same result .
i think my bishop is better in this position than his knight
the better move was probably 6.nxe4 , but here white still wins the majority of games .
now obviously , a better way to have approached this odd flank opening would have been with 1 .
better for white was bd4 or nd4 .
which would have been even better here .
nf3 might have been better , since it would n't be on the edge .
11 ... 0-0 was better .
better was rxe6 , changing a rook for a knight and bishop .
it would be better to expand on the queenside with 25. a3 and then b3-b4 .
32. g5 might be better , which is why i later decided that 28 .
... g5 was better .
... h6 was still better !
it might be better to keep the bishop on the board with 35 .
... h6 was still better !
black 's king is better off shepherding pawns , or gutting the king .
slightly better is cxb5 .
slightly better is b4 .
slightly better is be2 .
better is f4 , leading to 15 ... ng4 16.bd1 rxb2 17.qxb2 bxc3 18.qc1 nxe3 19.bxh5 bxe1 20.qxe1 , which wins a rook , a bishop , and a knight for a rook , a bishop , a knight , and a pawn .
better is nd3 , leading to 16.na4 qxd2 17.bxd2 nxe1 18.bxe1 nf4 19.bc3 bxc3 20.bxc3 e5 21.dxe6ep fxe6 , which wins a queen , a rook , a bishop , and a pawn for a queen , a bishop , a knight , and a pawn .
slightly better is be2 .
slightly better is ng4 .
white looks to be in better position here .
kh8 might have been better .
perhaps re1 or qe1 then bf4 would be better .
24 ... bd8 was better here which gives black chances to hold .
qb6 was obviously better , as the queen can give a check on b7/c6 when desired , and also stays safe from being trapped by nd5 - b4 - nc3 sequence
better be bb3 ?
maybe qc7 is better
pxd3 or even hxg4 would be better .
discovered check , winning the pawn and also allowing the n to move to better squares later .
bd6 ; qd6 was probably better , as it could then come in at g3 .
kg2 may have been better , as it stops the q coming in .
better was 4.nc3 , and then after 5.nf3 it becomes something similar to the four knights opening .
i played better in the third game but overlooked a threat that also allowed him to checkmate .
perhaps it would have offered better chances for black
maybe 13..kg8 would have offered better chances of survival
this is also a better spot for the bishop to reside , compared to the c4 square .
he would n't be better of playing for example 6 .
better was nf3 , attacking the rook - but releasing me from the potential threat c3 .
later this becomes a target , so maybe white would be better advised to develop first , keeping the threat of a5 ...
even 7 ... ..o-o is better for black on 7 ... ..nxe4 , qf3 or e2 or g4 is okay for black as the knight capture is again met with the d5 fork .
was ke8 better ?
miller sees that p-n3 is futile , but this move is n't any better .
the pawn structure that results from this is favorable to white because he has extra space and better control of the center .
qb4 qxb4 25. cxb4 , with the better endgame .
while this move loses the rook for black , the alternative is n't really that much better positionally ; 4 ... ke7 5.qxe5+ kf7 6.bf4+ d5 [ to stop qf5+ after the king moves to g6 ] 7.bxd5+ kg6 8.d4 and white already has a formidable attack
i bet i can handle that better tha a b pair later on .
[ % clk 0:04:51 ] now i think that retiring the b would have been the better option .
nd4 was much better .
e4 is a lovely square for one of my minor pieces , but it would be even better to have a knight on this square rather than a bishop .
rather than retreat or exchange , white chooses to block with the pawn and gain a better position
yeah , this was better .
bb5 , stops white from castle , and also the bishop is now functioning on a much better diagonal .
it would have been better to play e4 first as this allows 13. e4 .
i still think nd7 followed by bg5 or bh4 would have been better .
developing the bishop or nxh7 is better .
c3 is probably better , forcing my knight to retreat and preparing for an eventual d4 to open up the game .
always good to move the king out of the line of fire , but kh1 may have been better .
my experience is that is better to take the pawn with e6xd5 , because with c6xe5 my queen side becomes weak and exposed before i can castle kingside .
7 ... b6 followed by ... bb7 before playing ... c5 would probably do better ; this e6 pawn proves to haunt my position for a long time to come .
18 ... c4 would have been a much better choice .
i think 29.nd3 is better here .
i think ra1 is a little better at this point , to try to entice some trades and ease black 's pressure off .
queen retreats , with out any other developed pieces , i think developing the lsb or the knight on king side would of been better .
capturing white 's d pawn is better than trying to protect it as black 's position could become cramped pretty quickly
the sole idea is to keep white from castling to allow up a better game through superior and faster development .
if he is , why is 1 ) destroying his pawn structure queen side and 2 ) depriving his knight of the better c3 position ?
now , i was eying one of two things , either taking the unprotected h1 rook off by moving the e pawn up , or better yet , catching the white queen in the same diagonal as the king .
not a good move , the rook is much better off in an open or semi-open file
i could have started marching my e pawn up two squares to queen which probably is a better move than protecting a pawn
though this develops a piece , i actually think that c6 would have been better and if qxb7 then nbd7 .
probably would 've been better to continue development , nc3 would 've been more of a threat i believe .
not sure if there was a better move availiable , i think white 's ds-bishop was dead anyway .
a better move might have been bc4 to regain some territory and protect the rook .
a better move might have been to fienchetto my own bishop to g2 and take control of the long light squared diagonal that is unobstructed .
i felt that him getting his king to safety or opening up the middle was the better option here as it would have allowed him to take advantage of my poor support and positioning .
again , i am giving away momentum as castling here would have been the better move .
nb3- a better move might have been kf4 to prevent ke3 .
after nd5 , i decided against it but believe it would have been the better move since it would have protected both b7 and c6 .
i expected elyhim to start an attack right away , but his move was a lot better than i could have thought of .
would have though n32 would have been better for white as it give him more options while still protecting the bishop .
better would have been e3 to claim the blank file , although i would have responded re8 to pin the knight .
thexchange looked good for black , this way i would have a better game if black takes the pawn
now this is a mistake which i will take advantage of , better perhaps would have been bishop to b4
reasons for this move : develops a piece ; the game is very open , and the player with better development should have the advantage .
safety first , the king looks better protected , and i manage to unpin my knight .
looks like a clumsy and awkward move , but i ca n't think of anything better at the moment .
awaiting baron 's response ? in hindsight , a better move may have been b6 , but i was worried about the way my opponent 's pawns were storming my already weakened king side defence .
i think that had i played 4 ... a6 before developing my knight to c6 , my game would have been better , as in the next move i could attack the queen and gain some time to develop my other pieces .
there might have been better moves , but i was studying and i had to move quickly .
better would be exd5 , to open the centre , as black 's queen would still be developed too early
white 's centre is vulnerable , black would be better of playing nc6 to attack the pawn , continue development and slow white down by forcing him to defend it
again , d4 would be better , this move is too passive , allowing black the chance to achieve equality
black 's better options were probably bg4 or nd7 .
on reflection qxd4 would have been better although white is still ahead ... bf4 and white following with his move , exchanging pieces on a6 might have let me catch up .
and i made a silly move , but at the time i thought it was sheer brilliance ... ..on reflection 18 ... b6 followed by developing my bishop or thinking about protecting my king with a castle would have been a better option .
b3 would have been better for white
by now i am in a right mess , perhaps making my queen more active here would have been better
black goes on the pawn hunt but white has a clearly better position here .
black now has the option of ba4 but after rd3 , white has a better position and is threatening to reak havoc on black 's position .
i believe he would be better off with rg8 .
better was 5 ... qa5 .
better was 21 ... qc6 .
25.qb2 was better .
perhaps 28 ... rb5 is better .
i saw a better way to check white and save my queen at the same time .
a better move would be ne4-g3 to counter attack the bishop and regaining tempo .
better would be nf3 to develop are prepare for 0-0 .
better is nf3 with a gain in development over the text move .
better was nf3 followed by 0-0 .
better was qb7-a6 to protect the knight with the king .
the most predominant aspect that can be observed in this game is that it is better to develop pieces , castle , then begin an attack on the center or side where is makes most sense .
much better would be : ?
much better would be : ?
raf8 might have been better .
slightly better than exchanging the knight .
for example , in many positions it 's better to capture on c6 only after the bc8 has moved to d7 because capturing with the b-pawn will be weaker then .
12 ... ne7 - tempting white to play 13.d6 - is probably better .
probably better is be6 , with some protection of the d5 square .
what would have been better ?
i had completely overlooked that possibility , assuming , as i know better than to do , that white would retake on g4 .
the alternative , 29 ... rb6 , might actually have been better , but i wanted to push the issue .
surely 2r plus b vs 2r is no better than with one rook apiece ?
better was to take the pawn at once .
better would be re1 .
in retrospect , nb3 was probably one of the better ones .
perhaps a better move would have been moving my e pawn up which is a move i make and i would then have 3 pawns in a row but i seem to have forgotten this !
his queen moved to a better position aiming at castle pawn .
prevention is better than cure .
bg7 allows the dsb to work on a better diagonal .
be3 e6 ; which is supposed to be better , however my aim is e6 after d5 and a kingside attack , so be3 was not really on my mind .
alternative variation : 19 ... rd8 [ there is nothing better in the position ] this ruins black completely , it will open up the file for my queen and all hell can start to break loose .
there is probably a better place for the queen , which takes away the white kings only legal move .
i wonder if kc7 was better ?
bg7 is probably better followed by e6 and the knight finds a home on e7 .
so i did as he ca n't take on f6 really as after kg7 both pieces are attacked and rxc6 is met by dxr and my pawn structure is better and i am the exchange up .
exchanging his weakness on e4 for my pawn on f6 did not appeal as if you take all the pieces off bar the kings my pawn structure is much better .
lose h4 would have been better .
i think snatching the e pawn might have been better .
would n't rxe6 be better here ?
perhaps 16 ... bg6 preparing to open the h file if he takes is better .
may be better .
26.nb5 was better and made more sense as it also attacks the bishop and defends a3 .
now white has only one move to hold the position together , namely 28.nd5 where i 'm better due to the bishop but it 's nothing close to a win .
better would have been 5 ... ba5
although i feel that even after the exchange on f4 white is better due to his stronger pawn structure .
better for black would have been ... cxd4 11 .
be2 was better as it keeps queens on board and with two bishops in open position white has more than enough compensation for the pawn .
this is no better than the queen sitting on a1
for this reason , i think the move order played by mike williams is better .
this seemed better as to not have doubled pawns .
nd5 had to be played , but white is much better .
i think nf6 might have been better here to capitalize on the fact white can not readily defend with the queen side knight and develop a minor piece .
however , i can remove the remove the pin on f3 and threaten with my queen , i think that would be tactically better .
i do n't like this move , if only because i think black can do better , like with nfd7 .
much better was ned7 .
it might be better not to take the bishop here ... but white is obviously better .
i think the queen move was the better of the two choices .
possible nh4 would have been better .
retreats , but i thought nh2 or ne5 would be better .
perhaps better was nxb5 , with more threats , although the bishop move develops one more piece , and does n't open the space for the black bishops ...
black sees that he can take his pawn back , by exchanging one bishop for the knight ... loses the advantage of the 2 bishops , but material is even again , and black has perhaps a bit better pawn structure
getting his king in a better solution ... shows that 16 kd2 was not so good ...
grants his king a better position
therefore , i just did n't see the point as one move with the n does n't seem better or worse then the other .
but , better was to open up with 30.g3 , or 30.h3 .
i should 've kept it on b4 , where it would have been better placed .
better was to take with the other rook .
of course , jack is going to liquidate , but is better then letting him have another free piece .
bxd7 bxd7 [ was better than this ]
could n't resist the chance to get a half-open c-file in my sicilian like set-up alternative variation : 10 ... c4 11. a3 b5 [ is probably better for black . ]
rg3 is better , allows white to put rooks on the same line .
my monarch 's pawn cover was bursted and he needed to find a better place to hang out
... i think g4 is better , threatening g5 ...
i would have thought be2 or bd3 would be better .
bishop , on the a2-g8 diagonal is `` biting on granite , '' as they say , would have been better off defending the pawn on e4 ( `` over protection ''
not sure if that 's good as white is clearly going queenside and so opening the kingside seems better for white but it is a plan .
striking in the center is a good idea if you 're being attacking in the flank to try to create some counterplay but here d5 looks better .
better is g4 or taking on g7 and trying to rip open the center with dxe5 and taking advantage of the pressure and development .
not a game losing mistake , but white has gone from much better to slightly better with this move .
white is winning pawns for the pieces and with a weak black king is still better but this is not as good as the more solid dxe5 .
so white is better , and clearly has compensation for the piece .
white had a tempo and used it to ... allow the knight into a better square ?
white has better piece activity and better pawns and more pawns ( technically material is equal ) but this move allows for 3 connected passed pawns down the middle with rooks to back them up .
maybe exchanging the d pawn out first might be better for black opening more views to the white king
i believe n7xb6 was better to not have the skewer unprotected .
much better than kf8 , which would get me killed by 26 .
black is a pawn down , but with some compensation , in the form to two bishops , better development and some open lines .
i also considered by bc1 to be my better bishop , worth hanging on to .
but onwards the pawn marches - it may have been better to finish black 's development and prepare to play 0-0-0 .
dewi would have been better advised to develop his queen side .
well , 9.bd3 or even 9.bxa6 would certainly have been better here .
ra3 is better , then 15 ... e4 is dangerous , but white can breathe easier .
qb3 could have been better .
but here , probably a6 would have been better for black , since this allows me to ...
understandable , but 5 bc4 might be better .
the move is not too bad , although in hindsight , a better square for the dsb at this stage could have been e7 instead , choosing 4 .
black decides to move his b-pawn in order to give his lsb some breathing space , while also defending better the c-pawn
at this point , castling on the kingside would have probably been better for black .
surely taking b3 or even taking the diagonal passing from d2 would have been better ?
i said that better was just to move the pawn one square which prevents mate .
so here we are , with the lovely set-up .. me as white and down 7 points ... yeah , against a player what ... 500 or more points better rated ... i should resign and open the bottle , it would make for a better evening ... but the morning may be rough ... so i play on ...
the temptation is to take e4 and get material back , but i am thinking the more i can keep his king from being in a happy place the better off i am .
so he moves his king up attacking my knight , whoopee , tghe liquor store is getting better , wonder if there is a law about driving without oxygen on the brani..and , , , does tghe body break down ethanol to free up the the oxygen ?
things are looking better for white with e file being empty , maybe rook rf1 covering queen and ne4 .
blocks in my bishop , better is be3 .
white does need to develop , but a more modest move such as b-q3 or n-qb3 [ both of which also defend the exposed kp ] would serve him better .
any alternative - namely , kd8 [ best , i presume ] ra7 and rb8 [ the king has to move after nc7+ ] might have been better , but it 's hard to see what 's so bad about this move .
it turns out that it does n't fare too much better than nakamura 's shocker next move ... 16 ... bxb7 17.rxb7 and all five alternatives to avoid nc7+ turn out badly ; 1 ) 17 ... 0-0-0 18.bxa6 !
elyhim indicates a better move would have been a3 .
... nd4 is most likely a better thing to do..
i wonder if e5 would have been a better move as it would stop white from using the e6 square to place his pieces and limit my scope for attack .
4 ... d5 was a better opportunity for advancement
better was 5 ... ne5 ! .
okay for black , but better was 56 ... rc4 ! .
a better plan at this point would be 10 ... nbd7 , trying to create counterplay on the q-side after e.g .
a better move would have been possibly nd7 , ng5 , or dxe5 , but certainly not this .
rd8 would have worked better .
which is better in this position ?
21 ... ... was a little better .
but it just helps my q to go to a better square :
i think better was 22 ... ..rg8 .
for more passive play , e6 or d6 would be better .
better would have been be7 or o-o .
i kind of like rxf3 better as it preservers ne2+ , provided the queen can be lured away from protecting that square .
much better would be rc7 .
giving time to black to arm a better attack
it seems bg6 might be better choice
better to move the rook , perhaps to c5 , allow the f pawn to be taken , and then move my bishop to f5 to finalize deployment of my pieces , and protect against the q/b combo on g6 .
i feel like qd3 was a better move , as it set the queen on a diagonal with the black king .
i was expecting to lose the knight here , but i went with the simple theory that bishops are better in the endgame than knights
it puts the a2 pawn on notice , but perhaps 25 ... nc5 is better .
he now tries to gambit the pawn back to me , after blocking his bishop in , not the best move really , bg5 was better
this pin is the most sharp and probably the better reply to bg4
better is nc3 or be3 .
not a good square for the king , e8 looks better although it is quite unnatural to centralise the kingin this situation !
in such situations the knight is a much better defender than the rook .
after the game i told him that kd1 may have been the best , or maybe kd2 have been another better choice
better for black would have been rd6 , which allows nxb ...
reb1 , then white looks to have the better position
this move changed my mind about the rook sacrifice because now black will be able to control e6 too , and if the center opens up , were i down an exchange , the mobility on the board would wipe out any potential positional benefit ... and black 's king could also be protected better without black being cramped .
e1 may have been better , or perhaps even a1 ; but i did not want my rook on the f file to be completely hemmed in , and i was at this point still making plans on the kingside ...
pg5 might actually turn out better for black .
qd4 is better , because it puts pressure on f2 and protects the d pawn later on .
qd4 or qb2 is much better for black , and the endgame uncertain .
6 ... qf6 would have been better in this situation , but my thinking here was that black 's pieces would have more room after the recapture with the d-pawn ( and by pieces , i mean the queen and bishop
i reckon that if white had simply decided to trade off here , black would have come out better ; 15.bxf6 qxf6 16.qxf6 bxf6 - what black is counting on in this line is the fact that his seventh rank is more protected than white 's second rank , making it easier for black to break through
black moves it because he needs to castle , but i think moving the g6 then black 's bh6 is a better choice .
nd7 would have been better ?
this is better though , it makes it a lot easier to attack the weak white pawn on d3 , along the semi-open d file .
rc1 was better .
ne5 is given as better .
bg5 ng4 26. h3 be5 is given as better by pmca
qxb7 kg7 37. d4 as a better alternative , but not many players would allow checks on e1 .
white hits the queen , but only to drive it to a better square
qg4 kd8 as better .
re7 is given as better by pmca
kg2 qb4 is given as even better for white in the pmca
if white takes the pawn on b7 the black can develop with 8..nc6 and get a much better play than in this game ! !
i think better was b5 .
a better move would have been king in c6 .
is a better defence , when black has nothing better than to return the knight to d4 and try again .
it is the right of the better developed side to open lines and attack , so this move is a positional blunder .
black would be better to keep the position closed and try to catch up in development .
the knight is probably better placed on e7 , but perhaps black is saving that square for the f8 bishop .
black is continuing to improve his position , although white is probably still better with his passed e pawn .
bc2 when material is even , but white is better due to the superior minor piece and black 's isolated d pawn .
but really , 33 ... qc7 would have been better .
for better position of knight and to connect the rooks afterwards .
perhaps 17 ... exd5 as played by shirov later is better , but ivanchuk did get a beautiful win against him out of it with a queen sacrifice on g7 .
perhaps 7.ne3 would have been wiser and more sound , keeping control of the white central squares , but i wanted to develop fast .
played with the intention of supporting e3-e4 , but as self-adjoint pointed out , 15.h3 might have been better , allowing the bishop to maintain a line through the center .
this seems awfully underwhelming for the bishop 's second move -- surely 15 ... be6 would have been better .
defend the pawn with my bishop ( maybe 3. d3 would have been better here
i 'm not sure about this move anymore ... it would probably have been better to move the knight away .
white makes a threat that is easily averted - ba3 would have been better
seems better to develop a piece or even d3
a bit of an error , not massively so , but q-d3 would have been better .
really poor move , ne2 was better , after that i ca n't take the pawn .
white thought bg5+ to skewer queen , but then white saw if bg5+ then 9 ... nf6 and black would be safe for the moment ... then white saw and played the better bb4+ .
i have a hard time believing he anticipated a queen side castle but if that is so i almost fell for his plan , so the wiser move here is to let him eat with his knight if he wants and look for a more aggressive line ,
what i noted on the 21st move , as the n is now in a better place .
as chesskingdom64 would put it , `` almost any move was better then this . ''
it 's better then getting nervous which is something i also used to do , which is where the fight or flight syndrome , as i talked about , kicks in .
better was 95 ... kg6 , putting pressure right on the pawn , and with the r on g1 he gets some counterplay , as now white would face a threat .
... bd6 was probably better
feel free to comment and give lots of constructive criticism , for this was my 100th game and i wish for the next 100 to be better than the first !
even qg5 was playable , and probably better .
again , the threat is better than the execution .
probably , nc5 would have been better , even if it is pinned .
i think white is sligtly better placed than in the text , but anyway ...
better would have been 5 .
a much better move than 6 ... h6 .
better would have been more development , such as 7 .
better would have been 13 ... rfc8 or 13 ... rac8 , taking control of the half-open c-file .
better would have been a last chance attack on the black king or on black 's pawn structure .
h4 can be a better option , to definitely grab control of the kinside .
bxb is naive , but maybe better .
i 'm still not sure if bb5 would have been better
i do n't think i would have taken the rook though - i think my bishop is better than a rook and should contribute to a winning attack .
and black takes the g5 knight , but white has now the better position
g6 or bxe3 had been better .
this was n't in the data base so white has two options : maintain the pin with ba4 or be2 to better defend the kingside .
qh4 would have been better .
c3 would have been better .
better is qb3 .
i think kg1 is better .
5 ... f6 , or 5 ... g4 would have been better as they would have protected his g5 pawn .
i think bc4 or nbd2 were better .
i think kf2 was better , because it puts his king closer to the passed pawns .
after analyzing this move for some time , days after the game , i 'm not so sure if this was better than 18.nf5 or 18.nxe6 .
relatively better is to try and develop .
computer prefers a6 , but i think it is better to grab the 2 bishops in an open position .
i think this is a wonderful square to put the knight , and much better than taking on b3 .
computer actually prefers bc6 , with the idea of taking on f3 , but i think it is better to play this , my bishops are so good !
protecting the 2nd rank , but kg1 is better .
black does not want to trade his light squared bishop for black 's knight , the light one is better than the dark , because the dark squared bishop 's diagonal has been blunted by the pawn one e3 .
black could have played p-kb3 , which would have been better for two reasons .
the more orthodox 4.nc3 was probably better .
but i like my knight where it was , and did not like to exchange with bishop as this was going to be a closed game , and as they say , knights are better than bishops in closed games .
to embed my c3 knight on d5 by taking out the knight on f6 with the bishop ( closed game - knights better
i could have prepared better with a3 then the b pawn move , but 1. the bishop would not dare take the b pawn as i could do the nc7 forking attack .
instead of developing , he places the queen again , to another square that is not necessarily better .
bd2 was better ?
i would have thought a better option would be to simply retreat the queen to d8 or e7 .
white stands well due to the pinned g4 knight and has much the better placed pieces .
much smarter were 16 ... a5 , 16 ... qc7 keeping the tension or the safe and sensible 16 ... fxe5 17.fxe5 a5 with a very slight plus for black as he will have better control of the position through the pawn target on e5 .
3 ... d5 had been better ; after 4. exd5 qxd5 the position would smell like the scandinavian opening , but - relative to that - with advantage for black , since white can not play nc3
8 ... .bd7 or 8 ... a6 were probably better , the latter to prevent the odyssey of the white knight
the ng may have been better
qxq would have been better .
better would have been the rook .
white : yes , better than the other common moves dxc4 , c6 and e6 i think .
white 's plan was to win with better pawn positions by quicker movement on the queen-side : the idea was to move his a and b pawns two squares forward depriving his opponent the same move and slowing him down .
i was blinded by the promise of converting my little advantage into a free pawn and missed the much better qd6 !
14 ... bg4 might have been better , as 15. h3 would provoke black to reroute the bishop to g6 , where it 's optimally placed .
skipping the capture does n't leave white all that much better-off : 11.qd3 nxe2 12.nxe2 12 ... d5 13.nxh7 nxh7 and white will struggle to develop his queenside .
therefore , i believe that much better would 've been 28 ... ng5 either it 's n for b , but joe would 've been forced to exchange his more active b , though .
better is e5 leads to the exchange which wins a knight and a pawn for a bishop and a pawn .
slighty better is rc8
better is f6 which wins apawn for a pawn
better is ra5 which leads to exchange and wins a rook and a pawn for a rook and a pawn
better is fxe4 .
better is kh1 which wins a rook , knight and two pawns for a rook
better is rxh2 which wins a rook and a pawn for a rook .
better is g6 .
i think ne2 is slightly better , since it support a near-to-come bf4 , but any move is good , here .
probably better is bg6 , where bxb , hxb provides me with a semi open column that whorts something - not much , to be true .
i have saved my pieces and have the better position but i am being driven back and white has some resources , mainly due to his aggressive knight and bishop
the more of his pieces i can get off the board , the better i 'll be .
a better player could probably squash the black king in 2 or 3 moves .
was ke6 better ?
i wonder if qe7 was maybe better
in fact , i like this move better as since it does n't lose anything , black does n't move the same twice in the opening , which presents more opportunities to get the other pieces into play .
so , as i also told him , that better was 7 ... dxe4 , because this move loses a pawn .
believe it or not , i was thinking of a different position and gave him hw of why 13 ... kf7 , or 13 ... kd7 was better and how the piece was protected before the solution .
well , it was actually meant for this move , and better was 19 ... kg7 or 19 ... kf8 , as this move loses a r. i actually told him that those two were better moves .
nc7 but it was a mistake , na6 would have been better for ...
bg2 would have been better .
g5 would have been better , as it would have delayed an imminent mate .
better was [ 8.g5 ] keeping the h file closed .
ne7+ have been any better ?
better is 11..nd3 , pestering my rook .
better would be 3.nf3 !
the quiet 3 ... be7 would be better and less risky , especially since the move played may in fact lead to a win for white with best play .
better for white than this curious king move would be 8.d4 ! ?
d5 again was better because if the e-file opens i would simply just dominate the game
better than nxe4 , where white plays ne5 anyway , and fxe5 would be met with be8 # !
14.qg2 would have been better , but black is still much better .
white might have been scared of 15.nxe4 but it was still slightly better .
black could prevent this with 32 ... b4 , which may have been a better option than the move played .
black is forced to either defend the seventh rank with his queen or , slightly better , bring his king to c7 ; but after 41 ... kc7 42 qg7 qd7 43 qg1 kd6 44 qb6 white has a strong , although perhaps not a winning , advantage .
i almost think he 'd of been better off 0-0 instead .
is dead draw , and probably better for white ...
better was 30 .
better was d4 , probably .
perhaps it would be better to play nc7 or ne2 , but i decide to counter-attack his knight on f5 , which has been causing me problems .
the ending is clearly winning for black - he is a pawn ahead and his pieces are still on better squares , but i 'm not convinced that black has to even go into an ending .
kh1 would be a better choice , i could not decide in the game .
not quite a wasted move ... preventing a back-door mate is an okay plan , but with no immediate threat , perhaps a better position for your power pieces would be more valuable .
i like this move better than rd6 or re8 because i will eventually need to get my king down to help secure promotion of the pawns .
it is better for white to trade knight for pawn here rather than block .
this move releases the bishop to d7 , however i feel b6 to fianchetto the bishop to b7 , or c6 to support the d-pawn in an advance to d5 , would have been better .
defends the pawn , this is better than moving the king forward as now the knight has a square to move to on the kingside
this is a move i would hardly even consider , with such an open king white would be better to plan an escape route with possibly 18 .
better would have been rad1 , looking to counter attack the centre against the flank attack .
better would have been fxg6 hoping to make the position rather messy and difficult to calculate , the played move is very easy to play against .
there is only one reasonable options for the queen , but results in a loss of material ; 30 ... qd7 31.rc8+ qc7 32.qe6 rb8 33.qe8+ kb7 and black can stay in this [ this was a complicated series of moves though - i might have made a mistake here , or overlooked better moves ]
heck , would even ng5 be better ?
perhaps it 'd have been better for white to wait longer .
15. e3 was better threatening to take the pawn on d3 with his bishop .
i think dxc3 is a better try because in this line the rook quickly comes to e1 aiming at the king , but with the bishop on a5 that is not always possible .
i was looking at nd4 or bd5 ( engine tells me white is much better ) or maybe just taking on e6 and trying to deflect the black queen away and taking on b7 ( this is apparently winning , but i had n't seen the line yet .
and 56 ... h2 is not better .
rf2 might be better .
a bit crude ... better might have been ... e5 with ideas of bg4
tempting to develop , but i think pc6 would be better .
a good move , although bd7 would have been better .
i should have knew better .
n moved to a better position
there is no better square , as e7 is for queen and on d6 the bishop would be somewhat vulnerable .
but this is not better ...
better is 26 .
if 14 ... qh6 15.qc1 qc1 16.rc1 nd4 17.nd4 rd4 just better ending but two beshops with my openent .
better is qd7 followed by rdg8 , trying to spring the king .
i know i can lose my bishop now , but it 's better than losing my queen or rook
again mistake , i think it could be better to move on first line
i think it would be better if he close down my queen with his knight , but ...
i think rxf7 was better
ke7 was better to control f6 , f7 and f8
protecting the pawn with c3 was better .
qxe2 bxe2 kd8 defending the pawn but complitely bugging the development and white gains a strong initiative now ne5 is a threat or castle queen side and white is better here and nf6 sacrificing the pawn but sliping out from being passive but still white is good here and black has some problems .
preventing ne4 , plus f6 , right away ... slightly better is trying 9 .
i can only say that it is because freddy was so much better developed than nn when the g file was opened that his attack was so successful .
forced to move my knight , ok but where to move it that 's the question , rem it will be check in the next move , in the end better to be safe and move him back to f6
well the bishop is simply better placed on c5 than on e7 .
well in this position exchanging his dark squared bishop for my knight is just loosing for him since it is generally known a bishop is better than a knight .
i think bxn would have been the better move , at least he white would not go down another whole piece .
i decide to attack with my knight , but probably the move in kr ? l wladyslaw vs. porkolab sandor ( 2000 ) 2007 , bg7 is better .
the established move , kb6 is better .
the idea no doubt was to connect her rooks , which is something she needs to do , but maybe kd2 followed by ra1-d1 and kc1 was better .
i think castling queen-side was a better option for white .
i would let him do f4xe5 then i would do d6xe5 and he would be no better off .
normally one might indeed want his rooks on the centre files , but in this case , the rook was probably better positioned on b1 , where it gets to put on some pressure .
but in fact , to exchange bishops would heve been infinitely better .
loses the knight ; better would have been nf6 preserving the knight
ok , in order to prevent that i would have lost a dev move , opening a confrontation field wiht so many problems to solve ... no , i better stand this .
reopening the rooks line of attack , but bc7 is the better retreat as it would help in my fight for the d file in some lines later in the game
this is where it becomes obvious that the bishop is better placed on c7 as whites main asset would be his control of the d file and on c7 the dark squared bishop influences d8 allowing the rook to compete for the open file
white has the center and is about to get a passed pawn so maybe bf7 would be a little better .
better might be 11 .
he hopes in bh5+ , but i have a better move to play .
perhaps rd2 would have been better .
still on the cards , but he would have the extra pawn , and his pawn structure is better .
white is clearly better .
looks like the better of the two pawn captures , opening up a file for my rook as well
hmmm ... .not too sure what the purpose of this move is about ... . better might have been e6 or g6 to open up lines for the dark-square bishop [ or bxf3 , now that the queen ca n't capture back ]
i think black 's next move would have been better off played here ... this move turns out to be a problem later in the game
bringing my knight to a better square , and possibly eyeing the e5 square as a future knight outpost
the idea is ok , but could have been better timed .
5.d4 or 5.nc3 would have been better alternatives
better would have been to retreat the bishop to stop black 's next move ...
better would have been 12 ... a6
actually , black was still winning here , and would have been far better off playing fxg3 here , forcing off more material from the board ( and regaining the lost pawn , if white is careless ; 25 ... fxg3 26.rxf8 ?
would nf4 have been better ?
perhaps bg5 would be better ?
bxd5 might be better .
i think d5 is better here .
i like this move better than ne7 because it attacks the queen with tempo .
bc5 , this is not the most accurate move in this position , better moves would be nc6 , nf6 or bb4 .
to guard the base qp , but n-kb3 would be a better choice .
better was qc2 .
better was ... exf4 , after which black is better .
but i think taking here would have been better , opening up the middle ; black needs counterplay ...
since attack on h7 is not going to happen , moving queen to a better square protecting the bishop
... so better to remove it .
white 's pieces are better developed - pushing pawns forward with the idea to open up the black king more
of the two options available to the bishop , this one seemed better , with more scope , but it does n't look spectacular there , does it ?
perhaps 12 ... nh5 followed by f5 and attempting a kingside breakthrough was a better plan for black .
was bxn better ?
na7 was better , threatening both nxb and cxb
maybe it was better for black to hold the central d5 square by 8 ... c6 , after the game my opponent told me that he did n't like the idea of 8 ... be6 because of 9.ng5 and probably he will lose his bishop pare , and will get double pawns on f file .
i should have managed my bishops better in this match .
ke7 is still a blunder but better would have been hxg6 .
i decide however that i like the pressure on the king better than the the rook on c8 .
he decides to stay within the ranks of my king i wonder if rc1 is better .
better was moving the f rook sideways .
much better was : bxg7 , if rxg7 , rxf8mate .
only his dearly beloved better half can defend him now , so glenda moves to e1 on the next turn .
better choices would have been 6 ... d6 or 6 ... ne7 , to simply continue development .
any move that defended his rook would of been way better than the move he just did here .
as better would 've been to retreat her ra5 .
i like nxpf5 better , though moving this pawn does help clear the e file .
better would have been ... be7 or ... f6 .
but black might have done better with 17 ... nxf3ch !
no reason , that i can see now : c5 would have been a much better square for the knight .
... kg6 is better ) 67.kf5 h3 68.rg1
this move leaves the c6-pawn weak , but it seemed to me that it were better to give that one up for the two white k-side pawns than to relinquish the h-pawn .
- better was kd7 or kd5 .
i did n't foresee any necessarily better position for myself as a result of the sacrifice , but preferred it to the alternative .
i think any of the three possible responds could have been fine and i do n't know which one would be best , although having played the one you did , i think your move might have been better .
i preferred not to keep my bishop there , because if you took it , i 'd have to bring my knight to the wall , and because of the knight 's limitation of movement i tend not to want to bring them to walls unless there 's a better reason .
block the fork ... in hindsight 0-0-0 might have been better to bring rook into action .
fxe6 would be better .
black also opens up a space for his king but i like f6 better .
6 ... kd8 is probably better here .
his dsb needs a better square and h6 is still tempting , but black also wants to leave the h-file open for pressure against white 's upcoming castle .
black did n't have any immediate threats ; simple queenside development with 15.nc3 would have been a better choice .
perhaps rfe1 was better , but this has a clear goal of supporting the center , and preventing the black queen from infiltrating on d2 to cause trouble by double attacking bishop and b pawn .
in that , i gave up bishop for knight to gain and pawn , and then i prevented him from play the freeing c6-c5 and kept the position closed , so that my knight was far better than his bishop .
his knight seeks better squares .
now i 'm thinking bxh6 would have been better but that time has passed so i plough on ...
surely rxg8 is better ... ?
the middle-game : here too there is plenty of room for improvements and novelties and simply knowing or playing the variations better than the opponent .
so , if black play d5 , white play kd4 and the position is far better for them .
a counter-attack on e4 may have been better here
in hindsight i feel maybe nge2 was a better move , as this would have made it easier for my dsb to emerge later in the game .
i guess nd6+ was an option here that i missed at the time , forcing black to exchange bishop for knight , that might have been better than what i actually played .
i am open to suggested votes and believe for better or worse in taking the moves to the actual game .
the pawn , isolated as it is seems to me better placed on a3 , but stand to persuaded to a different view .
it is probably better not to wait upon 9.b5 , but shovel b and n out now-ish : 9.nc3 redfox17 : vote looking at 9 .
black will not want that to happen , of course , but at worst we will be better placed to challenge black 's possession of the central files .
it looks better now to me and i think ion is in agreement .
in end games featuring a queen , the knight often works better than a bishop .
i propose to get it moving towards the white queen , trying to skewer her in front of another rook or even better , the king .
then we get the knight in a better position .
i will follow the suggestion of the better players and try to understand .
probably better is just take on c3 to get nasty double pawns and try to attack it with qc7 maybe ?
yes , i think that is better .
would f6 have been better ... . ?
the position makes it difficult to find a better move , even the alternative 23 ... qd6 may hold some difficulties due to the threat of exchange sacrifice by rxe5+ fxe5 , and then a followup attack by bg6+
bd2 was better , in preparation of moving that knight .
) , or trying to find a better alternative .
i counter on the e file , and my rook is much better placed than his .
i have a rook for a knight and two pawns , but my pieces can coordinate better .
rc7 would be much better by keeping up the pressure .
looking to open the file , perhaps slightly better is 14 .
could even be better
threatening two moves ... but i was expecting rxd4 , because if i take the a6 pawn , he takes my c-pawn , and then my a pawn falls ... and he turns better ...
black takes his time in castling in order to get a better bishop .
white would have been better off playing rxph3 , to protect pe3 -- specifically qxpe3+ .
it is oftne a knee-jerk reaction to black 's pawn advance but white often does better to delay closing the centre .
i think though , that black would have been better off if he had just played ... ba6 at some point and left his queen 's scope untouched .
nxe4 is better .
and pxn pxn 8. cxb7 bxb7 is better for black .
either rf1 or re1 would have been better .
worst move any other move is better , all this move does is prepares me to mate him on g7 square
so it is better for me to wait white 's intention and release the dsb 's developement a little , while i have useful moves like ...
the attack on f2 was only a dream , so better to forget it .
given the passivity of my resulting game , i think in retrospect that 4 ... .g5 would have been the better option .
a better move would of been moving bishop to g3 .
however this is unneeded for , and 0-0-0 would have been better .
probably better was simply to retake on c5 .
the thing is that i understand ken much better then andy , so i do n't view any of white 's moves as pointless .
i think 16.bxd6 or 16.bg5 followed by bxf4 would have been much better .
in this position i think that white is better because his piecs on the center can be used wether to attack or to defend , which i not the case for black .
the pawn recaptures ; now all is looking a bit better for white , despite the fact that he is a knight and a pawn down ; all his pawns are strong , save the a2 pawn , which is defended now by the queen on e2 .
but bd6 is better , and it gives the bishop a better square .
kh2 qf2 # but this is no better , but it does have a better ending .
better to start positioning the enemy king where he is most vulnerable .
this line is at least equal , if not better , for white .
perhaps ne7 was better because it also controls f5 , but i liked the move because i needed the c pawn 's defender removed .
i think that h6 may have been better .
i think that h6 may be better .
better would be kh1 and doubling rooks on the g-file .
7 ... be2 is slightly better than this move .
white decides to mobilise her horse , would be better to steal a pawn back
the alternative was 12.0-0-0 , which might actually be the better choice , as it happens .
i identified a couple of later moves that did seem to harm black 's position , but the moves i recommended turned out to be no better , which suggested that in fact this pawn break had come at the wrong time .
i thought 17 ... rxf6 might have been the better option , but as earlier remarked , now i 'm not so sure .
are his defenses better queen-side ?
better for black was to take with the n first , so if i wanted to recover the pawn in a budapestian way , he would have had f5 .
to stop the pawn to get to the 7th rank i think , but better still is bf6
but there is no better choice to save both the king and the knight
i could have taken the c5 immediately , but i thought it is better to pose threat than execute one .
normally , i was told that it is usually better to develop the knight before the bishop , but there are exceptions .
in this position , c6 would have been better .
i thought a better 'waiting move ' would have been 39 ... a5 .
in earlier games i preferred to play d6 instead of the last knight move to banish the opponents bishop , but i figured out it would be better to perform a double-step with the pawn because it increases central control and -- for me personally more important , because that often has been a problem !
i guess the opponent should better have castled immediately instead of trying to get rid of my bishop .
my bishop retreats to a place that is better anyway , aiming white 's king-side .
bxa6 is better and would have developed a piece as well
... be4 blocking the e file may have been a better choice .
white holds his bishop and a better pawn structure than in the game
nh3 better , because it can go to f4 followed by nd5 .
better was 12 .
perhaps maneuvering the rook to the 8th rank was a better plan , but black is lost .
white should have taken my knight because moving his knight to d2 would have been much better than losing his rook .
not sure if kh1 would have been the better choice
the knight on c5 was a better piece than the bishop on d3 .
here he opened knight but i felt bishop there would be better and knight should go to f6
dxc6 is i think better , but rare
better than ba3 were it can be contested by qa4 double attack on c6 and ba3
maybe better was 16.kh1 to set black a trap and then 17.e5
a3 would have been a better square for this rook .
white 's other bishop is better placed on d3 than e2 .
black 's king has better be wearing kevlar .
better is ne7 followed by ne5 .
this is probably a much better move over 6 ... kxf7
f3 would have been much better , even though castling would be spoiled .
i emerged out of the opening with better development and initiative , white decided to end the game soon after it forcing a draw by 3-fold repetition , i need to find some improvement because this line seams great for black ...
even a move like [ 9 ... qe7 ] would have been better .
it was probably better to contest the d-file with a rook immediately .
perhaps attacking white 's a-pawn immediately was the better way to go .
nd7 would be better .
allows mate in one , better would have been qd7 .
if there is a better alternative , i 'd like to hear it .
probably better was 9 ... nf5 , to which i would have played nf3 followed by g4 .
unfortunately he stops this , so maybe e5 was better , but that does leave my d5 square weak , and he can play nc3-d5
so better was rc1 .
i was n't afraid of 15.ne5 bxd3 16.qxd3 ne6 , but i thought i might have had better .
much better was to accept the exchange , and yes , it 's where hyperfocusing on the small things becomes costly .
nd4 black is fine and it can even be said to be a better position .
it might have been better to simply move the rook to g8 .
it would have been better to simply exchange it .
better was an immediate 17 .
black stands better because now white can not castle and he can not even use f1 as a post for his h1 rook ad he ca n't mobolize his a1 rook either .
better was to immediately move the knight to f4 where it could have smoked out that troublesome d6 bishop and defended those light squares .
now that white ca n't get his knight to f4 , he tries to somehow mobilize his bishop to a better square .
black takes the time to get better king position .
better king position .
better is bb5 or bc4 , spanish or italian .
better than 16.qf2 qxf2 17.kxf2 bxe4 revealed check allowing black to gain a pawn .
better than 18.ne2 blocking , but then losing to ... bh5 and the knight is lost .
was qd7 better ?
be4 was a lot better ... ..or not considering re6 ?
seemingly preparing b5 , but is black better off with 13 ... e5 , solving the problem of the d7 bishop ?
it would have been better for white to castle even with the very small disadvantage here of an isolated pawn .
not the best move as it chases the bishop onto a very strong diagonal , better may have been d6 , or even d5 .
this move simply loses time , better would have been to either play nc6 , bg4 , or be7 .
nxd3 may be better , since black might want to quickly move into an end game , given that he has a pawn advantage at this point and after xd3 , the pawn structure of white is suboptimal .
the correct defense is therefore to immediately move the knight on e7 to a better defensive position .
the analysis here suggests this is an inaccuracy and offers b3 as a better move .
question one : 3 nf3 ... . or 3 c4 ... which is better ?
this is my main question , which is better : 5 bd2 or 5 nbd2 ?
perhaps xe5 would have been the better decision .
i do n't think e5 would be a good move here , but i do think it 's better than bd3 .
castling would be better .
this time i was determined to score better .
the idea is to defer ... d6 and develop instead , hoping to transpose to better variations .
but with this move order , probably better is 3.nc3 !
... but white did n't understood it and keep playing according to the previous plan , better was 0-0 , and white could have recaptured with the rook after bxf3
again keeping up with the previous plan , better was to postpone the development of the knight , to keep the control of the d4 and e5
allows white a slightly better pawn structure , but the lack of queens on the board , represents less worries with defence for black
i thought it was better than 14 ... .rxd8 , so that my rook could protect the f7 square .
better was 17.h3 to prevent the threat , but best was 17.g3 which also prevents mate , but at the same time , gains time , and wins the r , at the same time because i 'd have to retreat , and then you take .
better was nb6 to respond nd5 to a3 without having the knight exchanged .
4.e5 would of given white better chances because of his early takeover of the centre .
nxf1 is better .
instead , he might play a move like 10.d5 ! , and white seems to have the better position then .
there are probably better moves than this in the position , but i was concerned about king safety .
what moves would have been better then ?
the bishop is proving to be extremely effective for white , black would have better exchanged it !
better still was retreating to f4 , attacking the undefended d-pawn .
i 'm planning on doubling up my rooks behind that weak h-pawn , but driving the rook away with 20.f4 was a better plan .
fortunately , black goes for exchanging down a little too soon , missing the better chance .
clearly it 's better to keep this pawn covered and bring my king into the game .
i pondered and pondered on which was better - taking the pawn with the rook or going after it with the king and so keeping black 's king from advancing .
this game is a training match to help my teammate get better .
i think that white is better if they take my knight on c6 , causing me to double up some pawns , as this play allows me to double and isolate his c pawns completely , which could cause some trouble later on .
ultimately i liked the options provided by f6 better .
mistake ... .be2 was far better as it would break the pin .
just comes down to the higher rated doing better ... .
it is better here on e7 as it helps facilitate either pawn break .
in light of his next move , maybe 12.exf4 is better and then 13.bd3 follows if he does not recapture with is bishop .
better is to double r. bg4 was probably best .
this is better .
hiding my king , developing the rook and breaking two pins , but even after all that , black is still much better and with more tempo for the time being .
frankly , he probably had better options , starting with perhaps actually capturing the knight ?
i do n't like this move , but i 've got no better alternatives for black , as the king is just beyond saving at this point .
wanted more backup on d4 pawn , better than bf4 i think because d4 pawn make move while e5 pawn wont .
i think it 's better if black castles kingside , because then it 's hard to attack him from there , and black can focus more on his space advantage .
castling kingside was better since attacking with my g and h-pawns would be weakening to my position .
exd4 is probably better , even though opening a position should benefit the bishops , it gives black more space to come up with some counterplay , unlike in this closed position , black 's only chance is a do or die kingside attack , but my threats on the queenside are too quick .
so , better move the rook .
i think nb2 was the better play .
this move was better than kc1 , as it will allow na3 and rook/queen/rook connections .
na3 would have been better if you do n't want to trade rooks here .
black would have been better off taking the pawn .
better was an immediate 7. h4 , when , if black plays 7 ... be4 , white can play 8 .
better was 7 ... c5 .
perhaps 18 ... c4 to push the q off that diagonal before moving the rook to defend g7 would have been better , also fixing white 's weaknesses on c3 and c2 to enable a swift counter-attack with an appropriately timed ... qa4
i do n't want to leave one pawn by itself out on the right so i better use my queen or my horse
at this stage i figured i better move my knight .
i 've managed to save my castle and i 'm still in better shape than him on the board .
it 's better for me just to develop a piece .
now black has three minor pieces , for the price of his queen and a pawn , a roughly even trade , although i 'm 1 in material count , the material is too imbalanced to say who is better here .
this move is better now that d5 has been played , and black has no a-pawn to harass my bishop with .
knight back to protect bishop and make the knight better protected whilst also maintaining control on the centre of the board
apart from my doubled pawn i am in a better position on all fronts .
it is not clear that it would have led to anything better than the text does .
might it have been better played now , with the threat ... ng4 ?
i still think that it would have been better for white to somehow open the c-file .
better would have been rxe7+ or qe2 .
better probably was bd7
or playing the knight onto e8 may have saved something of blacks position , both of which are better than putting the knight on the wing .
5 ... nb6 seems somewhat better : the knight on f6 shields direct pressure from bg7 and forms a target for the advance e4-e5
better was to expand immediately on the queen side with 10 ... b5 .
i was thinking about taking the pawn by en passant just for shits , but i thought better of it .
i think exf6 may have been better , to keep the king 's pawn row intact for casting .
good choice , but better was d5 !
better was c4 , imo .
better was ne3 .
the white knight can go to c4 , true , but this is a better place for the pawn .
n sacrificing a pawn to get a better development and to difficult black 's positional play , even if black does n't take it i 'll be better on the endgame
i 'd like to have a better way to show them than copypaste gk algebraic annotation ...
but shoos back up to +0.57 with this move , so perhaps 34 ... . kh6 was better ?
the immediate qxe5 was probably better , leaving white to decide whether to exchange or not .
joe also said , `` much better would have been : 5.ng5 , h6 6.nxf7 , kxf7 7.nc3 , f3 8.gxf3 , be7 9.qe2 , bxh4+ and now above , the advantage in position , control and tempo is reversed and in blacks hands would have been extremely favorable for the win . ''
and this is practically forced , since i do not want to lose my better bishop .
another knight is transferred to a better attacking position .
